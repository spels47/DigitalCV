i take pride in my work.
i am passionate about what i do.
i enjoy working with programming and coding challenges.

i enjoy having some free reign when it comes to how the feature or product works, 
because once i start working on a problem or is implementing a feature i get creative inspirations on how i would like to do specific 
things or how i could add some cool little thing to what im making.

im a critical thinker.
im a free speech absolutist.

i find a lot of happiness and satisfaction from having my code run well and do what its supposed to do well,
or see that my code provided value and gets used by people, 
more so than the compliments that i might get from coworkers.
